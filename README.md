# Personal-Portfolio - Project One

This is a website I have created in order to showcase the Frontend developer skills I have learned to date through the Learning People Full Stack Developer course. My website will be used to promote myself and my skills to find emplyment opportunities in the future. Potential employers will be able to browse my website to learn about my experience while also viewing some of the Frontend skills I have developed.

## UX
***

My website is for potential employers who may be interested to learn a bit more about myself, my past experience and my hopes for the future. I have incorporated who I am as a person, where I have come from and where I am headed. My aim was to promote myself as a human being with both a personal side to my life as well as a career side. I have included multiple different methods to get in contact with myself in the hope of attracting some communication.

The style and layout of the website was chosen to promote my persoanl values of family and nature. The colour of the text and masks are used to work with and showcase the background image and personal photo.

## Features of the Website
***

### All Pages

- **Background Image**: Stunning scenic background image of beautiful mountains, chrisp calm water and reflections of light. I believe thsi image is an eye-catcher and a thought provoker which I feel my websites will be. I want the user to be transported to a happy place while also learning a bit about me along the way. Life and nature are very important to me, so I wanted to capture that in my website.
- **Vertical Navigation Bar**: I chose the vertical navigation option as It seemed most portfolios I studied used the standard horzontal bar at the top of the screen. I am showing I like to think outside the box and am not afraid to challenge myself to make a design different and standout from the rest. The Navigation bar is to the extreme left of the screen on larger devices, so as not to block or take away from the background image. I have also styled the Navbar to be transparent and allow the user to still see the background image. The navigation links within allow the user to move between pages on the website.
- **Collapsible Navbar** : On smaller devices below width 768px the Navigation bar will collapse to a toggle button on the top right of the screen. This responsiveness allows the user to still have full view of the background image and full access to the navbar on smaller devices.
- **Mask applied behind text**: I have added a mask behind the text on each page to allow the text to be easily read and not hidden by the background image. The colour styling of the text was also chosen to pop out from the colouring of the background image.
- **Social media links**: Incorporated into the footer are clickable icon links to make contact or view my various social media sites (LinkedIn, Github and Facebook).
